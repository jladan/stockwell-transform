# Stockwell transform library

This is a small library of functions to implement discrete Stockwell transforms
in Python. Note that the discrete Stockwell transform and orthonormal version of
it are "phase-corrected" versions of Morlet wavelets and harmonic wavelets
respectively.

These are based on the matlab functions created during my Master's research.
